# _Irving's Computer Repair and Anti-Virus_

If you're reading this, there's a good chance that you, at some point or another, became your extended family's __COMPUTER PERSON__.

It's not a responsibility any among us asked for, but now, when you visit home for Christmas, you're greeted by a stack of wheezing netbooks, filled to the brim with viruses you thought were long-extinct.

## With All Sincerety...

Although I did burn this HTML file to a disk and write "Computer Repair" on it in sharpie, I figured it would have been too mean-spirited to actually distribute it to any of my direct family members.

That being said, I __do__ have a lot of blank CDs... :^)
