# _Irving's Computer Repair and Anti-Virus_

If you're reading this, there's a good chance that you, at some point or another, became your extended family's __COMPUTER PERSON__.

## With All Sincerety...

Although I _did_ burn this HTML file to a disk and write "Computer Repair" on it in sharpie, I figured it would have been too mean-spirited to actually distribute it to any of my direct family members.

That being said, I __do__ have a lot of blank CDs... :^)
